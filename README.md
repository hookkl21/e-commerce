## Welcome to My First E-Commerce Website

## Goal:

- Practice key concepts of React.js functionality and other in demand skills needed in front-end development
- Sharpen problem solving/critical thinking skills for better user experience
- Practice better error handling, authorization process, and design

## About:

- E-Commerce website for home furniture with full CRUD functionality
- Fetches the API for loading the products (not from the real stores)
- User can look up the products just like any other furniture store website (i.e City Furniture)
- Authorization is implimented for security
- User must Login in order to navigate to checkout

```
